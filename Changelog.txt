USBHelperLauncher 0.15b Changelog:

* Added patch to override public key, reduces launch time compared to the previous method
* Renamed runtime argument `--nopatch` to `--nokey`
* Realigned debug message headers

**Note**: Newtonsoft.Json and SharpCompress are not included as they already come with Wii U USB Helper.
Real purchased donation keys will not work, though infinite new ones can be generated.
This can be turned off by running the launcher with the argument `--nokey`.
